# LinguiSticks
Hi! Welcome to LinguiSTICKS! This website is a tool anyone can use to learn about languages and how they came to be. Whether you're going on a business trip to a foreign country, traveling, vacationing, or just want to say hello in German, this is the resource for you!

When you click on a country from the homepage, you will be redirected to that specific language's origin, where it is used in the world, common phrases, and links to more information. 

We also have information about the history of language itself, the psychology of language and communication, and a spot to discover languages that are dying out.

Enjoy!
